This value can be used by a client to checkpoint where\nthey are in the list of changes, and ask for only changes that come after the given id. This is convenient, because the\n_afterHistoryId is based on a unique identifier. The client does not need to worry about duplicates which otherwise occur\nwhen using _since to sequentially fetch history</p>\n<h2>lastModified timestamp</h2>\n<p>In a highly concurrent system, several resources could share the same timestamp. Also, the internal id used to identify individual resource changes may not correlate perfectly with the lastModified time. To guarantee no data is skipped, clients should not process resources with a lastModified timestamp.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 15, 2021","path":"/guides/pagination","title":"06.
